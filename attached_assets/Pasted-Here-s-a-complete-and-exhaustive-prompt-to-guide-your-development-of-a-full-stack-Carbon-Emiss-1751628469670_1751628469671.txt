* Electricity usage (monthly, kWh)
* Fuel/LPG usage (liters/month)
* Vehicle travel (km/week or liters/week)
* Flights (short haul, long haul)
* Food habits (vegetarian / mixed / meat-heavy)
* Shopping & lifestyle (monthly spend)

#### Industry Inputs:

* Type of industry
* Energy sources (grid kWh, diesel, coal, etc.)
* Process emissions (cement, metal, etc.)
* Logistics: Distance × Mode × Load
* Waste generation: kg + type
* Water usage

### 3️⃣ **AI/ML-Driven Output Dashboard**

**Core Components**:

* 📊 Emissions breakdown (Scope 1, 2, 3)
* 📈 Forecast emissions (Prophet/Regression model)
* 💡 AI Optimization Suggestions:

  * Switch to renewables
  * Route optimization
  * Energy efficiency measures

**ML Features** (on backend via FastAPI):

* Regression Ensemble → Predict emissions based on similar historical industry data
* Forecasting → Future emissions trend (Prophet or ARIMA)
* Offset Suggestion → ML classification based on user profile
* Risk Assessment (industry) → If carbon cost is mismanaged

## 📊 Example Backend AI API Endpoints (FastAPI)

```python
@app.post("/predict-emissions/")
def predict_emissions(data: EmissionInput):
    # Run regression + forecast model
    results = model.predict(data)
    return {"total_emissions": results.total, "forecast": results.forecast}

@app.get("/offset-suggestions/")
def suggest_offsets(profile: UserProfile):
    suggestions = ai_engine.recommend(profile)
    return {"actions": suggestions}

@app.get("/optimize/")
def optimize_strategy(data: InputData):
    strategies = optimizer.run(data)
    return {"energy_savings": strategies.energy, "route_opt": strategies.logistics}
```
